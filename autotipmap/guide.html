                <p>You can import your delivery history from Google Maps using Google Takeout. Here's how:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Open your web browser and go to <a href="https://takeout.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Takeout</a>.</li>
                  <li>Scroll through the list and find <strong>"Maps."</strong> Make sure its checkbox is checked and it says "1 selected" at the top. If other items are checked, uncheck them &mdash; exporting extra data will take much longer. Tap <strong>"Next step."</strong></li>
                  <li>Make sure <strong>"Send download link via email"</strong> and <strong>"Export once"</strong> are selected. Tap <strong>"Create export."</strong></li>
                  <li>Google will prepare your file. This is usually almost instant, but can sometimes take a little while. You'll receive an email when it's ready.</li>
                  <li>Open the email titled <strong>"Your Google data is ready to download."</strong> Tap the link and download the .zip file to your phone. It's usually named something like <code>takeout-maps.zip</code>.</li>
                  <li>Return to Auto Tip Map and go to <strong>Settings &gt; Data Management &gt; Import Data</strong>. Select <strong>"Google Maps Backup"</strong> and choose the .zip file you downloaded.</li>

                <p>When the overlay detects a delivery offer on your screen, it shows a popup with information about the address from your order history. This helps you decide whether to accept the offer. The popup will show one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>New Customer</strong> &mdash; the address has never been seen before</li>

                <p>The popup is draggable &mdash; tap and hold to move it anywhere on your screen. It appears automatically when an offer is detected and disappears when you leave the offer screen. If multiple addresses are visible, all of them will be shown.</p>
