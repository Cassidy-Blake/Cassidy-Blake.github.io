          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="privacy-updated">Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Auto Tip Map ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information. We are committed to transparency about our data practices and to keeping your data under your control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Delivery and Order Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Delivery addresses (street, city, state, and zip code)</li>
            <li>Order numbers</li>
            <li>Order amounts (subtotals)</li>
            <li>Platform pay amounts (base pay from the delivery platform)</li>
            <li>Tip amounts and tip percentages</li>
            <li>Bonus amounts</li>
            <li>Order and tip dates</li>
            <li>Time between order completion and tip receipt</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.2 Location Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your device's current location, used solely to display your position on the in-app map</li>
            <li>Coordinates derived from delivery addresses, used to place delivery pins on the map</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.3 User-Entered Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tip scores (ratings you assign to delivery locations)</li>
            <li>Notes you attach to delivery locations</li>
            <li>Work shift start and end times (if you use the time-tracking feature)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.4 Notification Content</h3>
          <p>If you enable the notification listener feature, the App reads notification text from your device to detect tip alerts. Only notifications matching tip-related patterns are processed. The tip amount and order number are extracted; all other notification content is discarded immediately and is never stored.</p>

          <h3>1.5 Screen Content</h3>
          <p>If you use the screen-capture feature, the App reads order information displayed on your screen. All processing happens locally on your device. Raw screen images are not stored by the App.</p>

          <h3>1.6 Device and App Information (Collected Only When You Submit Feedback)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Device manufacturer and model</li>
            <li>Operating system platform and version</li>
            <li>App version and build number</li>
            <li>Contact email address (optional, only if you choose to provide it)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.7 Crash Reports</h3>
          <p>If the App encounters an unexpected error, a crash report containing the error message and technical details is generated. These reports do not contain your personal data, delivery information, or earnings.</p>

          <h3>1.8 App Preferences</h3>
          <p>Theme settings, tip-scoring thresholds, and feature toggles. These are standard app settings and contain no personal or financial data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>

          <h3>2.1 On-Device Storage</h3>
          <p>All delivery data, order records, bonus entries, time entries, and location data are stored locally on your device within the App's private storage area. No other apps can access this data.</p>

          <h3>2.2 Android Backup</h3>
          <p>If you have Android's built-in backup enabled on your device, the App's database and settings may be backed up to your personal Google Drive account through Android's standard backup system. This backup is managed entirely by Android and your Google account &mdash; the App developer has no access to these backups. You can disable this in your device's system settings under "Backup."</p>

          <h3>2.3 Manual Backup and Export</h3>
          <p>You may manually export an encrypted backup file from within the App. You control where this file is saved and with whom, if anyone, it is shared.</p>

          <h3>2.4 No Cloud Database</h3>
          <p>The App does not use any cloud database, remote server, or third-party storage service to store your delivery, order, or earnings data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>3. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
          <p>Your data is used solely to provide the App's core features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Displaying delivery locations and tip history on the map</li>
            <li>Calculating earnings summaries and statistics</li>
            <li>Scoring delivery locations based on tip history</li>
            <li>Tracking work shifts and hours (if enabled)</li>
            <li>Showing your current position on the map</li>
            <li>Automatically detecting and logging tips from notifications (if enabled)</li>
            <li>Reading order information from your screen (if enabled)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>

          <h3>4.1 We Do Not Sell Your Data</h3>
          <p>We do not sell, rent, license, or trade your personal information or delivery data to any third party for any purpose.</p>

          <h3>4.2 Map Display</h3>
          <p>The App loads map imagery from a third-party tile provider to display the map. These requests transmit only the map area being viewed and do not include any of your personal or delivery data.</p>

          <h3>4.3 Address Lookup</h3>
          <p>When the App converts a delivery address into map coordinates, the address is sent to a geocoding service. This is used solely to place pins on the map.</p>

          <h3>4.4 Crash Reporting</h3>
          <p>Crash reports are sent to a third-party crash reporting service to help us identify and fix bugs. These reports contain only technical error information. They do not contain your personal data, delivery addresses, order numbers, or earnings information. No user identifier is attached to crash reports.</p>

          <h3>4.5 Feedback Submissions</h3>
          <p>If you choose to submit feedback through the App, the information you provide (feedback category, description, optional contact email, and general device information) is sent to our server to be delivered to the developer. This is entirely voluntary and user-initiated.</p>

          <h3>4.6 No Analytics or Advertising</h3>
          <p>The App does not use analytics tracking, advertising SDKs, or any third-party service that collects user behavior data.</p>

          <h3>4.7 External Links</h3>
          <p>The App contains optional links to community pages. Tapping these links opens your device's web browser. The App does not send any data to these platforms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>5. Permissions and Why We Need Them</h2>

          <h3>5.1 Screen Capture</h3>
          <p>Used to read order and delivery information displayed on your screen. All processing happens on your device. You must explicitly grant this permission each time you start the feature.</p>

          <h3>5.2 Notification Access</h3>
          <p>Used to detect tip notifications automatically so the App can log tips without manual entry. Only tip-related content is processed; all other notifications are ignored. You can enable or disable this at any time.</p>

          <h3>5.3 Display Over Other Apps</h3>
          <p>Used to show information on your screen while you are using other apps. You must explicitly grant this permission in your device's settings.</p>

          <h3>5.4 Internet Access</h3>
          <p>Used to load the map, look up address coordinates, submit crash reports, and send feedback when you choose to do so.</p>

          <h3>5.5 Location</h3>
          <p>Used solely to show your current position on the in-app map. Your location is never transmitted to our servers, stored in our records, or shared with any third party. You can deny this permission and still use the App; the map will simply not show your current position.</p>

          <h3>5.6 Notifications</h3>
          <p>Used to notify you when a tip has been automatically logged. You can disable these notifications at any time.</p>

          <h3>5.7 Photo and Media Access</h3>
          <p>Used to allow you to select screenshots from your device for import. The App only reads images you explicitly select.</p>

          <h3>5.8 Background Operation</h3>
          <p>Used to keep the screen-reading feature running reliably while you use other apps. A persistent notification is displayed whenever this is active.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>All data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Delete individual orders, locations, bonuses, or time entries from within the App</li>
            <li>Export a backup before deleting data</li>
            <li>Uninstall the App, which removes all locally stored data</li>
            <li>Clear the App's data through your device's system settings</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Crash reports sent to our crash reporting service are retained according to that service's standard retention policies.</p>
          <p>Feedback submissions are retained only as long as needed to address your feedback and are not used for any other purpose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
          <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All delivery and order data is stored in the App's private storage area, which is inaccessible to other apps on your device</li>
            <li>Manual backup files are encrypted</li>
            <li>Network communications use HTTPS encryption in transit</li>
            <li>The App does not store passwords, payment information, or authentication credentials of any kind</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The App is designed for use by gig delivery workers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
